    "recipe": "Universal Taco Seasoning\n========================\n\nI got tired of buying packets of store-bought taco seasoning, so I experimented with various spices and ratios until I landed on this recipe. I keep a jar of it in the cupboard at all times.\n\n* 6 tbsp chili powder\n* 4 tbsp cumin\n* 4 tbsp corn starch\n* 3 tbsp onion powder\n* 1 tbsp salt\n* 1 tbsp garlic powder\n* 4 tsp oregano (Mexican oregano, if you've got it)\n* 2 tsp crushed red pepper\n\nCombine in Mason jar and shake well to combine.\n\nThis mix works well for chicken, pork and beef, destined for the grill, oven, slow cooker or stovetop. You could tweak it a bit to target a specific meat, but I like to have a base, universal mix around. Makes it super easy to turn leftover anything into delicious taco filling: Just chop up whatever it is, toss it into a skillet, sprinkle generously with seasoning, then add a bit of water and simmer to impart flavor.\n\ntags: vegetarian, vegan\n",

    "recipe": "Simple Salsa Verde\n==================\n\nI got this base recipe from a vegan friend. If you can't find one of these peppers, swap in another one!\n\n* 6 Average-sized tomatillos\n* 1 Poblano pepper\n* 1 Serrano pepper\n* 1 Jalapeno pepper\n* 1 Sweet red pepper\n* Juice of 1 or 2 fresh-squeezed limes (to taste)\n* Pinch or two kosher salt (to taste)\n\nYou're in charge of the heat here. For a milder salsa, remove all the ribs and seeds inside the peppers. For medium, leave in a few ribs, and for hot, go nuts. Rough chop the peppers and tomatillos, then throw into a blender or food processor with salt and lime juice. Pulse to desired consistency.\n\nAs with most salsas, this will taste better if you let it sit in the fridge for a few hours before eating. It's great on chips or drizzled over steak or pork tacos.\n\ntags: vegetarian, vegan\n",
