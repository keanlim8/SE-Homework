 3.  Suppose that you want to sort the books on your bookshelf, say into alphabetical order, by hand. What would be a good algorithm for doing this?

Does the answer change if you have very many (say thousands) of books? Does it depend on what order the books are currently in?

4. can you use sorting to remove all duplicate elements from the list 4 1 6 3 8 4 2 9 4 5 1 7 3?*/
